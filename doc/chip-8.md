# What's CHIP-8?

## Introduction

CHIP-8 is an interpreted programming language. It is composed of a
set of 31 instructions, each acting either on data registers or the screen
display.

The data registers are the primary utility for manipulating values. In Chip-8,
you have 16 data register + 2 timer registers + 1 address-specific register:

 * Data registers:
   * `V0` through `VE` - Eight bits general purpose registers.
   * `VF` - Also a 1 byte register, but it is often modified by certain
     instructions to act as a flag.
 * Timers:
  * Delay timer - Its value will be decremented at a rate of 60Hz until it
    reaches `0x00`.
  * Sound timer - Similar to the delay timer, but when it is non-zero, a sound
    frequency is generated by the speaker. The minimum value at which it
    responds is `0x02`, setting the sound timer at `0x01` having no effect.
 * The I register - A 12 bits register dedicated to store memory addresses.

## Instructions

`N` is a hexadecimal digit.
`X` and `Y` represents arbitrary data registers.

### Arithmetic

 * `6XNN` - Store number `0xNN` in register `VX`
 * `8XY0` - Store the value of register `VY` in `VX`
 * `7XNN` - Add value `0xNN` to register `VX`
 * `8XY4` - Add value of register `VY` to `VX`. Set `VF` to `0x01` if carry
   occurs (i.e. the result is greater than 256), to `0x00` if it doesn't.
 * `8XY5` - Subtract `VY` from `VX`, setting `VF` to `0x00` if a borrow occurs,
   to `0x01` if it doesn't.
 * `8XY7` - Set `VX` to the value of `VY - VX`, setting `VF` to `0x00` if a
   borrow occurs, to `0x01` if it doesn't.

### Logic

 * `8XY1` - Set `VX` to `VX ∨ VY` (OR).
 * `8XY2` - Set `VX` to `VX ∧ VY` (AND).
 * `8XY3` - Set `VX` to `VX ⊻ VY` (XOR).
 * `8XY6` - Store the value of register `VY` shifted one bit to the right in
   register `VX`. Set `VF` to the least significant bit prior to the shift.
 * `8XYE` - Store the value of register `VY` shifted one bit to the left in
   register`VX`. Set `VF` to the most significant bit prior to the shift.

### Randomness

 * `CXNN` - Set `VX` to a pseudo-random number with a mask of `0xNN` (i.e. the
   drawn number goes through a logical AND with `0xNN` before being stored in
   `VX`).

### Jumps

 * `1NNN` - Jump to memory address `0xNNN` (i.e. continue program execution
   from this new address).
 * `BNNN` - Jump to address `0xNNN + V0`.

### Subroutines

 * `2NNN` - Execute subroutine starting at address `0xNNN`.
 * `00EE` - Return from a subroutine.
 * `0NNN` - Execute machine language subroutine at address `0xNNN` -
   **DEPRECATED**

### Conditional branching / Skips
