# Documentation

This directory contains all the documentation we've written while designing and
realizing our CHIP-8 interpreter.

All the design documentation can be found under the `design/` directory. It
gathers all the design choices we had to make.

All technical documentation is under the `technical/` directory. You will find
find there how our design choices were actually implemented.

Also, we've written a little document that summarizes what CHIP-8 is and how it
works. You will find it in this directory ([What's CHIP-8?][0]).
